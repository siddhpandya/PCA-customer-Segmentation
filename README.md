# PCA-customer-Segmentation
Classify the customer according to types of wine
## Pre-requisite
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](https://www.w3schools.com/python/pandas/default.asp)
* [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
## Flow
* Through pandas we load CSV file and form a dataframe
* Identify Target and features
* Split the data in training and testing dataset
* Apply a StandardScaler
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation that converts a set of correlated variables to a set of uncorrelated variables
* LogisticRegression to train the data
* Plot graph for segmented customer
